# The Student Guide to Revolve2
This guide is a work in progress, but for now some very quick directions:
- You need Linux. Windows or Mac will not work. Windows subsystem for Linux might work but it has not been tested yet. Mac definitely does not work. You can try dual booting or a virtual machine.
- The revolve source is here https://github.com/ci-group/revolve2
- The revolve documentation is here https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/
- Follow the installation guide from the documentation. You will need the optional Isaac Gym environment supplementary package. Depending on your experiment topic you might need other supplementary packages as well, discuss that with your supervisor.
- **If it does not install, update both `pip` and `setup-tools` and try again.**
- Follow the tutorials, they serve as a starting point:
